[ "The Burley Community: Preserving the Past","2015","The Burley Utopian Community was part of the growing Social Equity Movement of the latter part of the 19th and early part of the 20th centuries. The origin of the idea of seeding the United States with Socialist Communities came from an organization led by Eugene V Debs. Debs was a veteran of the labor troubles that gripped the nation beginning in the 1880's and culminated with the deaths of thirteen workers during the Pullman Strike. Debs began to believe that the only hope for the workingman was Socialism. With that in mind the national Socialist organization looked for opportunities to spread the Socialism, Washington State was selected as the site of the colony, chosen because of its history of labor activism and a smaller population that would be sympathetic to the cause. Thus was born the town/colony of Brotherhood, a name that was soon surrendered for the commonly used, Burley. Plagued with troubles from the onset, the colony lasted only 15 years. This is story of a community that has survived, not so much physically, but in spirit, a spirit that still holds this small community together today. That spirit can be seen in the words of Barbara Laxson who is a longtime resident who lives in one of the original homes built by the colony where an oral history was recorded. It can also be heard in the words of Maria Moore, an American citizen born in Mexico who lives now in Burley. Mrs. Moore, is a former member of the Burley Community Association the group that is charged with maintaining the community properties, her interview was conducted in the community park. In their words you can begin to understand why it is so important to try to keep and keep the history and the name Burley alive today.","", "/tchp_dev/items/tchp572.html" ],

He operated the store for several years. At the time the K Street business sector, one of the city's twelve business districts, was second only to downtown Tacoma in terms of business activity. Businesses such as hardware stores, banks, small department stores, appliance dealers, butchers, markets, cleaners, clothing stores, and restaurants lined the streets. In 1960, he moved to 11th and Broadway and opened what to become the quintessential men's store \"Mac the Knife,\" later shortened to \"Mr. Mac's.\" At the time the Tacoma business district was being adversely affected by the building of the Tacoma Mall which would, after its completion, lure many of the surrounding businesses to it. Mr. Mac stayed, however, and became president of the K Street Booster Club, an organization dedicated to promoting the interests of small family owned businesses and the community that surrounded them. In addition to having an active interest in the business community Mr. McCollum also became dedicated to the areas youths and his interests in sports, boxing in particular, lead him to becoming involved with the Tacoma Athletic Commission, eventually becoming its president in 1978.

Disease would continue to wage war against the residents of the City of Destiny until the Fannie C. Paddock Memorial Hospital and St. Joseph Hospital were built in 1882 and 1891, respectively. Both organizations developed meaningful relationships with their community and ignited a behind-the-scenes competition which would benefit both patient and physician. Almost 100 years later, Tacoma was cared for predominantly by primary care physicians. It had just started to see an influx of medical specialists via Madigan Army Medical Center when the city was hit by HIV in 1983. With no effective cure at the time, Tacoma did its best to cope with the disease and its associated complications, and the infectious disease specialists were on the forefront. One of these few physicians was Dr. Peter Marsh. Born in  Chicago in 1949, he was inspired to become a doctor as a young boy by the Dr. Kildare film series. Arriving in Tacoma in 1981, he would find himself in the middle of handling the AIDS epidemic, supporting patients as best as he could before they succumbed to the disease; that is, until the introduction of antiretroviral medications. Now able to effectively cure patients, Dr. Marsh found new life in his work and continued to serve his community until retirement in 2015. With the epidemic under control, Tacoma still utilizes what it learned from that chaotic era to stand prepared for anything thrown its way.","", "/tchp_dev/items/tchp594.html" ],

As of yet the Tacoma Community History Project has no oral history pertaining to South Tacoma; thus it is an aim of this project to resolve that omission.

The interview was conducted in such a manner so as to be as respectful to Mr. Olson while at the same time keeping the focus of the interview on the changes and history of South Tacoma. The results of the interview show that indeed prior to I-5 and the Mall the South Tacoma Business District was a thriving, wholesome area that catered to the everyday needs of the surrounding residents. However, the completions of I-5 and the Mall undoubtedly altered the atmosphere of the area; Mr. Olson can attest to these changes.

Board of Education decision and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Tacoma School District took voluntary measures to desegregate a select number of schools with high non-white enrollment. The district superintendent, Dr. Angelo Giaudrone, drew attention to the de facto segregation, and primarily focused on two elementary schools: Stanley Elementary, with a black population of 64 percent and McCarver Elementary, with a black population of 84 percent. In 1963, a subcommittee was formed to analyze and study the de facto segregation and provide recommendations for potential solutions. On July 8, 1966, a plan was announced by the school board for an optional enrollment program that relied on closing McCarver Junior High and to provide limited open enrollment to students affected by the closing. The district hired its first black principal, Willie Stewart, in 1970 in order to bridge the divide between the school district and the black community. Stewart led the summer counseling program to work with families on the transition between the closing of their neighborhood school and their new school of their choice. According to the United States Commission on Civil Rights a decade later, the summer counseling program was pivotal to the success of the voluntary desegregation program in the Tacoma School District.","xyz", "/tchp_dev/items/tchp629.html" ],

[ "Perspectives on Tacoma School Desegregation: From Family Values to Program Evaluation","2017","Born in rural, eastern Montana, Bruce Arneklev, 79, can be seen as an unlikely match to have led the Tacoma School District's desegregation program evaluation in the 1970s. Arneklev earned his bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of Oregon and his Educational Doctorate in educational psychology at Utah State University before moving out with his family of five for an evaluation role with the Tacoma School District. Arneklev was hired to evaluate the district's Emergency School Aid Act for its first four years, 1973-1977. ESAA was a federal program that funded school desegregation efforts. Tacoma began voluntarily desegregating its schools in 1966 with a limited school choice enrollment for its segregated central-area schools and expanding to district-wide enrollment policies to reduce effects of de facto segregation over the next three years. Arneklev worked for an additional twelve years in the district's evaluation department before working as a school psychologist for ten years, retiring in 2000. He lives in the North End of Tacoma with his wife, Dixie, dog, Charlie and has several children and grandchildren in the Tacoma area.","xyz", "/tchp_dev/items/tchp660.html" ],

[ "Engaging Tacoma Buddhism: Acculturation at the Tacoma Buddhism Temple","2019","In April of 2019, a Pacific Lutheran University Religion 393 class set out to interview members of the Tacoma Buddhist Temple with the purpose to study the acculturation of religion and the ways that the role of religion in the Tacoma community has changed overtime. The class was broken down into three groups of 3-4 students each in order to interview Miyoko Kanda, Donna Sasaki and Crystal Inge, who are all members of the Tacoma Buddhist Temple. Each person was interviewed in order to glean more information about the time period they were most active in and specific questions regarding temple culture. This project was initiated with the intent to preserve the different perspectives of the members mentioned above through oral history as an ongoing project to collect and archive oral histories of relevant members of Tacoma from its foundation to present day.","xyz", "/tchp_dev/items/tchp671.html" ],

[ "Farming in the Time of Pandemic","2020","This project is based off of oral interviews, recorded and transcribed, with Thurston County farmers: Ann Petricola and Joel Baranick of Ellis Creek Farm and Kevin Jensen of Riverbend Ranch. The research essay explores the immediate trends seen in small farms during the first four months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spring 2020. In a time of great uncertainty and fear, small farms across the US suddenly saw a spike in interest for direct to consumer sales while also facing processing bottlenecks and financial uncertainty. The experiences of Ellis Creek Farm and Riverbend Ranch paint a picture of small farms as safe, flexible, and community oriented sources of food and highlight some of the specific challenges they have faced during this time.","Farms, Small;Local Foods; Food Secuirty; Covid-19 (Disease), Oral History", "/tchp_dev/items/tchp689.html" ],

[ "Pandemic in Her Baby Sling: The Iranian American Women's Story of Migration Traumas and Labor Hardship During 2020's COVID-19 Pandemic","2020","Since COVID-19 started to become a global pandemic, it has caused personal and public traumas. Increase in unemployment rate, bankruptcy of small businesses, financial stress to the middle and working-class and the closure of many businesses which relied on people’s social activities, including the gig industry, tourism industry and restaurants, are additional traumas to the issues of health and life threats people face by the contingency of the virus. By the end of May 2020, more than 2 million Americans were confirmed COVID-19 positive, 113 thousand of whom could not survive. Amongst the most affected populations, the people of color, especially Black Americans and immigrants have been suffering most. This research focuses on immigrant working women from the Middle East, whose life journeys are filled in with several traumas, some intensified during the pandemic. This paper provides two oral history records of two Iranian American working mothers, Aida Mohajer and Mrs. Ebrahimi, who carry historical traumas experienced in two different countries with two different cultures, i.e. Iran, and the USA. The interviewees’ stories show how the experience of trauma is related to the social class and what imposed social factors beyond choice can determine the class and different approaches to traumas.","COVID-19 (Disease); Iranian American women; single mothers; immigrants; precarious employment; oral history", "/tchp_dev/items/tchp695.html" ],

All of them spread death and misery throughout the population. This essay takes a look at ordinary people and how they dealt with natural and man- made crises during their lifetime and how they are coping now with the threat of Covid-19. Two people are interviewed for this project, an African American man from Baltimore MD and a White American woman with Scottish heritage from a rural area in WA State.
