"Tacoma Judaism: One Hundred Years","The interviews with three members of Tacoma&#39;s Jewish community, Richard Rosenthal, Steph Farber, and Ruth Hurst, to some degree all touch upon the exodus of businesses (many of them Jewish-owned) from the downtown Tacoma business district. In two interview segments, Rabbi Rosenthal discusses early Jewish settlement in Tacoma, the 1960 merger of existing Conservative and Reform congregations to form Temple Beth El, and adds some details about his early life and training. Farber recounts his beliefs about misguided urban renewal practices of the 1960s and 1970s and reminisces about the many businesses that once flourished in downtown Tacoma. The transcript of the interview with Hurst appears to provide only an excerpt; she discusses her family business, Feist &amp; Bachrach, as well as other downtown Tacoma stores operating prior to 1965.","","","1992","","","","","Farber, Steph--Interviews; Hurst, Lucille--Interviews; Rosenthal, Richard, 1924-1999--Interviews; LeRoy Jewelers (Tacoma, Wash.); Temple Beth El (Tacoma, Wash.); Central business districts--Washington (State)--Tacoma; Jewelers--Washington (State)--Tacoma--Interviews; Jews--Washington (State)--Tacoma--Interviews; Jews--Washington (State)--Tacoma--History; Rabbis--Washington (State)--Tacoma--Interviews; Single mothers--Washington (State)--Tacoma--Interviews; Stores, Retail--Washington (State)--Tacoma--History; Women sculptors--Washington (State)--Tacoma--Interviews; Tacoma (Wash.)--Commerce--History","","","University of Washington Tacoma Community History Project","","chp1992-05","","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-EDU/1.0/?language=en","text","cpd","","","188","tchp188","","https://digitalcollections.lib.washington.edu//utils/getthumbnail/collection/tacomacomm/id/188","","erika-b.github.io/tchp_dev/items/tchp188.html"

"The Burley Community: Preserving the Past","The Burley Utopian Community was part of the growing Social Equity Movement of the latter part of the 19th and early part of the 20th centuries. The origin of the idea of seeding the United States with Socialist Communities came from an organization led by Eugene V Debs. Debs was a veteran of the labor troubles that gripped the nation beginning in the 1880&#39;s and culminated with the deaths of thirteen workers during the Pullman Strike. Debs began to believe that the only hope for the workingman was Socialism. With that in mind the national Socialist organization looked for opportunities to spread the Socialism, Washington State was selected as the site of the colony, chosen because of its history of labor activism and a smaller population that would be sympathetic to the cause. Thus was born the town/colony of Brotherhood, a name that was soon surrendered for the commonly used, Burley. Plagued with troubles from the onset, the colony lasted only 15 years. This is story of a community that has survived, not so much physically, but in spirit, a spirit that still holds this small community together today. That spirit can be seen in the words of Barbara Laxson who is a longtime resident who lives in one of the original homes built by the colony where an oral history was recorded. It can also be heard in the words of Maria Moore, an American citizen born in Mexico who lives now in Burley. Mrs. Moore, is a former member of the Burley Community Association the group that is charged with maintaining the community properties, her interview was conducted in the community park. In their words you can begin to understand why it is so important to try to keep and keep the history and the name Burley alive today.","","","2015","","","","","","","","University of Washington Tacoma Community History Project","","chp2015-01","","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-EDU/1.0/?language=en","","cpd","","","572","tchp572","","https://digitalcollections.lib.washington.edu//utils/getthumbnail/collection/tacomacomm/id/572","","erika-b.github.io/tchp_dev/items/tchp572.html"

"The Puyallup Land Claims Settlement: A Lesson in Struggle","Examining the social, economical, and communal effects of the Puyallup Land Claims Settlement of 1990, this research essay explores these various elements through the assistance of an interview conducted with the current Puyallup Tribal Chairman, Bill Sterud. Sterud was also the Puyallup Tribal Chairman at the time of that the settlement took place, providing a vivid recollection of the Tribal community before and after the settlement and how the settlement changed the course of the Puyallup Tribe of Indians forever. This research essay also explores several of the major issues found within the non-Indian community surrounding the land claims settlement as well.","","","2015","","","","","","","","University of Washington Tacoma Community History Project","","chp2015-03","","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-EDU/1.0/?language=en","","cpd","","","577","tchp577","","https://digitalcollections.lib.washington.edu//utils/getthumbnail/collection/tacomacomm/id/577","","erika-b.github.io/tchp_dev/items/tchp577.html"

"Alicia Pike, Point Defiance Zoo and Aquarium, and Point Defiance AAZK: Wildlife Conservation in Tacoma","This project focuses on the significance of zoos and local volunteer groups on the promotion and successful implementation of conservation efforts. More specifically, this project focuses on the efforts of Point Defiance Zoo and Aquarium as well as the Point Defiance chapter of the American Association of Zoo Keepers. This project includes an interview with fulltime keeper and Point Defiance AAZK president, Alicia Pike, who assisted in providing significant insight into the last fifteen years of conservation efforts in Tacoma. Ms. Pike has been working in the zoological field and an active member of AAZK for over a decade. She has worked at several zoological facilities in both Washington and Oregon. Furthermore, she has been directly involved in the implementation and success of several conservation efforts, including the red wolf breeding program at Point Defiance Zoo and Aquarium. In the context of the zoo, she assists in the care, breeding, and maintenance of the Sumatran tigers, lowland anoa, small-clawed otters, and clouded leopards as well as the care for other endangered species at the zoo. She has lead and continues to lead many of the keeper talks at Point Defiance Zoo and Aquarium, providing information and facilitating Q&amp;A sessions with the community so as to inspire local participation and promotion of wildlife conservation. As both an active member and president of Point Defiance AAZK, Ms. Pike has helped organize and lead several local conservation efforts that work directly with members of the local Tacoma community. Over the course of our interview, Ms. Pike not only discussed the significance of Point Defiance Zoo and Aquarium and AAZK as facilitators of conservation, but also discussed at great length the relation between these organizations and Tacoma, describing Tacoma�s general receptiveness to the work of conservation efforts and citizen scientists.","","","2015","","","","","","","","University of Washington Tacoma Community History Project","","chp2015-04","","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-EDU/1.0/?language=en","","cpd","","","583","tchp583","","https://digitalcollections.lib.washington.edu//utils/getthumbnail/collection/tacomacomm/id/583","","erika-b.github.io/tchp_dev/items/tchp583.html"

"Morris McCollum: Tacoma&#39;s Hilltop Community Icon","Mr. Morris McCollum, &quot;Mr. Mac&quot; as he affectionately known, is one of Tacoma&#39;s most respected business and community leaders. He is certainly one of the longest lasting. Shortly after arriving in Tacoma in 1957 Mr. McCollum purchased the K Street Department Store which was located on the corner of 12th and K. He operated the store for several years. At the time the K Street business sector, one of the city&#39;s twelve business districts, was second only to downtown Tacoma in terms of business activity. Businesses such as hardware stores, banks, small department stores, appliance dealers, butchers, markets, cleaners, clothing stores, and restaurants lined the streets. In 1960, he moved to 11th and Broadway and opened what to become the quintessential men&#39;s store &quot;Mac the Knife,&quot; later shortened to &quot;Mr. Mac&#39;s.&quot; At the time the Tacoma business district was being adversely affected by the building of the Tacoma Mall which would, after its completion, lure many of the surrounding businesses to it. Mr. Mac stayed, however, and became president of the K Street Booster Club, an organization dedicated to promoting the interests of small family owned businesses and the community that surrounded them. In addition to having an active interest in the business community Mr. McCollum also became dedicated to the areas youths and his interests in sports, boxing in particular, lead him to becoming involved with the Tacoma Athletic Commission, eventually becoming its president in 1978. Recognized by the city of Tacoma with the 2004 Martin Luther King Jr. award Mr. McCollum remains a leading figure.","","","2015","","","","","","","","University of Washington Tacoma Community History Project","","chp2015-05","","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-EDU/1.0/?language=en","","cpd","","","589","tchp589","","https://digitalcollections.lib.washington.edu//utils/getthumbnail/collection/tacomacomm/id/589","","erika-b.github.io/tchp_dev/items/tchp589.html"

"Upholding the Hippocratic Oath: A Story of Medicine in Tacoma and its Fight Against AIDS","From the very beginning, Tacoma was met with illness in the form of typhoid. Disease would continue to wage war against the residents of the City of Destiny until the Fannie C. Paddock Memorial Hospital and St. Joseph Hospital were built in 1882 and 1891, respectively. Both organizations developed meaningful relationships with their community and ignited a behind-the-scenes competition which would benefit both patient and physician. Almost 100 years later, Tacoma was cared for predominantly by primary care physicians. It had just started to see an influx of medical specialists via Madigan Army Medical Center when the city was hit by HIV in 1983. With no effective cure at the time, Tacoma did its best to cope with the disease and its associated complications, and the infectious disease specialists were on the forefront. One of these few physicians was Dr. Peter Marsh. Born in  Chicago in 1949, he was inspired to become a doctor as a young boy by the Dr. Kildare film series. Arriving in Tacoma in 1981, he would find himself in the middle of handling the AIDS epidemic, supporting patients as best as he could before they succumbed to the disease; that is, until the introduction of antiretroviral medications. Now able to effectively cure patients, Dr. Marsh found new life in his work and continued to serve his community until retirement in 2015. With the epidemic under control, Tacoma still utilizes what it learned from that chaotic era to stand prepared for anything thrown its way.","","","2015","","","","","","","","University of Washington Tacoma Community History Project","","chp2015-06","","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-EDU/1.0/?language=en","","cpd","","","594","tchp594","","https://digitalcollections.lib.washington.edu//utils/getthumbnail/collection/tacomacomm/id/594","","erika-b.github.io/tchp_dev/items/tchp594.html"

"Blood, Sweat, and Tears: Nhung and Thanh Huynh&#39;s Oral History","In 1973 the war in Vietnam had ended for the United States and by 1975 the Vietnam War had effectively ended altogether. Following the end Vietnam War, the life of the South Vietnamese people would be disrupted and the new regime in Vietnam would implement harsh new laws and regulations against the South Vietnamese population to stabilize the new government. The chaos towards the end of the Vietnam War led to the United States to accept large numbers of Vietnamese refugees into the country. Did the United States do enough to help the refugees, or did their concerns go unheard? The purpose of this oral history project is to gain thoughtful information about the perspectives of Vietnamese refugees and their trials and tribulations during their voyage to freedom and once they arrived to America. This oral history project includes personal stories of Nhung Huynh and Thanh Huynh&#39;s refugees escaping on boat and their lives while waiting to resettle in America.","","","2015","","","","","","","","University of Washington Tacoma Community History Project","","chp2015-07","","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-EDU/1.0/?language=en","","cpd","","","603","tchp603","","https://digitalcollections.lib.washington.edu//utils/getthumbnail/collection/tacomacomm/id/603","","erika-b.github.io/tchp_dev/items/tchp603.html"

"Jack McQuade: Renewal of Historic Swiss Pub Coincides with Growth of the University of Washington Tacoma","This project is comprised of an oral interview, recorded and transcribed, with Mr. Jack McQuade, co-owner of The Swiss pub, located at 1904 Jefferson Avenue, Tacoma, WA. The research paper investigates the factors involved when Mr. McQuade started this business during the early 1990&#39;s, as well as, examining how this  helped revitalize and preserve the south downtown Tacoma setting on the UW Tacoma campus. The Swiss is a first-rate location for inspection due to its existence for over 100 years. Mr. McQuade has been the owner for as long as UW&#39;s 46 acre downtown campus has been in existence, his insight provides invaluable perspective on the transition over last 25 years of both the campus and his business in relation to one another.","","","2015","","","","","","","","University of Washington Tacoma Community History Project","","chp2015-08","","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-EDU/1.0/?language=en","","cpd","","","609","tchp609","","https://digitalcollections.lib.washington.edu//utils/getthumbnail/collection/tacomacomm/id/609","","erika-b.github.io/tchp_dev/items/tchp609.html"

"South Tacoma Then and Now","The purpose of this oral history was to interview Floyd Olson in order to capture his perspective and memories as they pertain to the South Tacoma Business District and how it was transformed due to the construction of I-5 and the Tacoma Mall. Mr. Olson is a lifelong South Tacoma resident and has vivid memories of the time both before and after I-5 and the Mall. As of yet the Tacoma Community History Project has no oral history pertaining to South Tacoma; thus it is an aim of this project to resolve that omission. The methodology used was a personal interview with Mr. Olson using pre-conceived, open-ended questions based on prior research. The interview was conducted in such a manner so as to be as respectful to Mr. Olson while at the same time keeping the focus of the interview on the changes and history of South Tacoma. The results of the interview show that indeed prior to I-5 and the Mall the South Tacoma Business District was a thriving, wholesome area that catered to the everyday needs of the surrounding residents. However, the completions of I-5 and the Mall undoubtedly altered the atmosphere of the area; Mr. Olson can attest to these changes. The implications of this oral history are in laying the foundation for future studies on South Tacoma.","","","2015","","","","","","","","University of Washington Tacoma Community History Project","","chp2015-09","","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-EDU/1.0/?language=en","","cpd","","","615","tchp615","","https://digitalcollections.lib.washington.edu//utils/getthumbnail/collection/tacomacomm/id/615","","erika-b.github.io/tchp_dev/items/tchp615.html"

"Telegrapher for the Northern Pacific Railway in Tacoma","Gary Emmons was in a unique position in the 1960s, working for the Northern Pacific Railway as a telegrapher. He was witness to the change from manpower to computers. The telegraph station at McCarver Street in Tacoma, Washington was one of the most important stations in the area. Trains would not leave Tacoma, unless they had received their instructions from this station. This paper will provide a brief history of not just the McCarver Street station, and how it operated, but also other institutions, that were intricately connected to the Northern Pacific Railway here in Tacoma; institutions such as McKinley Hill Hospital, the Great Tacoma Shops, Union Station and, very briefly, the decline and the revival of downtown Tacoma and the restoration of Union Station, as well as the present campus of the University of Washington, Tacoma. This research will cover a span from approximately 1910 to 2000 and follows loosely the interview conducted with Col.

"When Races Collide: Willie Stewart and the Voluntary Desegregation of Tacoma Public Schools","On the heels of the Brown v. Board of Education decision and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Tacoma School District took voluntary measures to desegregate a select number of schools with high non-white enrollment. The district superintendent, Dr. Angelo Giaudrone, drew attention to the de facto segregation, and primarily focused on two elementary schools: Stanley Elementary, with a black population of 64 percent and McCarver Elementary, with a black population of 84 percent. In 1963, a subcommittee was formed to analyze and study the de facto segregation and provide recommendations for potential solutions. On July 8, 1966, a plan was announced by the school board for an optional enrollment program that relied on closing McCarver Junior High and to provide limited open enrollment to students affected by the closing. The district hired its first black principal, Willie Stewart, in 1970 in order to bridge the divide between the school district and the black community. Stewart led the summer counseling program to work with families on the transition between the closing of their neighborhood school and their new school of their choice. According to the United States Commission on Civil Rights a decade later, the summer counseling program was pivotal to the success of the voluntary desegregation program in the Tacoma School District.","","","2017","","","","","xyz","","","University of Washington Tacoma Community History Project","","chp2017-02","","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-EDU/1.0/?language=en","","cpd","","","629","tchp629","","https://digitalcollections.lib.washington.edu//utils/getthumbnail/collection/tacomacomm/id/629","","erika-b.github.io/tchp_dev/items/tchp629.html"

"Perspectives on Tacoma School Desegregation: From Wallflower to Rabble Rouser","The child of left leaning social activists, Laurie Arnold grew up during a time of great change in the country and the Tacoma community. The same year Laurie started first grade, McCarver Elementary in Tacoma became the first magnet school in the country and began the desegregation process of Tacoma Public Schools. Though Laurie only attended through fifth grade, her experiences there lasted a lifetime. Throughout her educational journey, Laurie attended many schools, and the one that remained clearest in her memory was McCarver. One of her fondest memories was Friday Activities, and she could still recall the teachers she had as well which teams she belonged to. Laurie lived in Hilltop most of her childhood and only spent about seven or eight years away before returning home to Tacoma for good. In that time, she lived and attended schools in Seattle until age fourteen. Roughly a month into her ninth grade year, Laurie dropped out of school and moved to Florida until age seventeen. Upon her return, Laurie completed her GED, Associate�s, Bachelor�s, and Master�s degrees all in the South Puget Sound region. She taught at the Tacoma Urban League for many years before she found her way to Bates Technical College where she currently works. Laurie continues to serve the Tacoma community and is a proud Hilltop native.","","","2017","","","","","xyz","","","University of Washington Tacoma Community History Project","","chp2017-03","","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-EDU/1.0/?language=en","","cpd","","","635","tchp635","","https://digitalcollections.lib.washington.edu//utils/getthumbnail/collection/tacomacomm/id/635","","erika-b.github.io/tchp_dev/items/tchp635.html"

"Still Fighting after All These Years: A Puyallup Tribal Member&#39;s Perspective","Nancy Shippentower-Games is a member of the Puyallup Tribe in Washington State. Nancy&#39;s parents are Donald and Janet McCloud. She has seven siblings and grew up on the banks of the Nisqually River and Puyallup Rivers and currently resides in Yelm, Washington. Nancy grew up during the fishing wars that took place on both the Nisqually and Puyallup Rivers. Her mother Janet McCloud and her uncle, Billy Frank Jr., were very active advocates during the battle over salmon. She remembers vividly the violence, racism and injustices that she and her people suffered as they fought for what was rightfully theirs. By revisiting the circumstances and propositions set forth in the Medicine Creek Treaty of 1854, a better understanding of what the Puyallup and Nisqually tribes have been fighting for comes into focus. While the Boldt Decision of 1974 was a turning point for Northwest Tribes, concerns such as climate change, overpopulation, and proposals such as the LNG plant in Tacoma continue to put the salmon runs at risk.","","","2017","","","","","xyz","","","University of Washington Tacoma Community History Project","","chp2017-06","","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-EDU/1.0/?language=en","","cpd","","","646","tchp646","","https://digitalcollections.lib.washington.edu//utils/getthumbnail/collection/tacomacomm/id/646","","erika-b.github.io/tchp_dev/items/tchp646.html"

"Philip H. Red Eagle","Philip H. Red Eagle was born in 1945 in Tacoma, Washington. His mother, Marian Steilacoom, of Salish decent, was born near Port Angeles, Washington. Philip&#39;s father, Philip Red Eagle, a member of the Dakota Tribe, was born near the Missouri River on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in Montana. Phillip spent the first fourteen years of his life in Tacoma, attending Stanley and McCarver schools before moving to Sitka, Alaska with his family in 1959. Philip joined the Navy shortly after graduating from high school, serving in Vietnam for five years from 1969-1973. After Vietnam, Philip returned to Washington and began undergraduate studies at the University of Washington where he earned two bachelor&#39;s degrees. The return to civilian life after the war affected Philip and he struggled with PTSD and related issues like depression and insomnia. Philip found that art, writing, and taking part in the revival of his culture helped him confront his PTSD and over the last 30 years Philip has contributed greatly to the revival and expansion of Indigenous culture in the Pacific Northwest.","","","2017","","","","","xyz","","","University of Washington Tacoma Community History Project","","chp2017-07","","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-EDU/1.0/?language=en","","cpd","","","653","tchp653","","https://digitalcollections.lib.washington.edu//utils/getthumbnail/collection/tacomacomm/id/653","","erika-b.github.io/tchp_dev/items/tchp653.html"

"Perspectives on Tacoma School Desegregation: From Family Values to Program Evaluation","Born in rural, eastern Montana, Bruce Arneklev, 79, can be seen as an unlikely match to have led the Tacoma School District&#39;s desegregation program evaluation in the 1970s. Arneklev earned his bachelor&#39;s and master&#39;s degrees at the University of Oregon and his Educational Doctorate in educational psychology at Utah State University before moving out with his family of five for an evaluation role with the Tacoma School District. Arneklev was hired to evaluate the district&#39;s Emergency School Aid Act for its first four years, 1973-1977. ESAA was a federal program that funded school desegregation efforts. Tacoma began voluntarily desegregating its schools in 1966 with a limited school choice enrollment for its segregated central-area schools and expanding to district-wide enrollment policies to reduce effects of de facto segregation over the next three years. Arneklev worked for an additional twelve years in the district&#39;s evaluation department before working as a school psychologist for ten years, retiring in 2000. He lives in the North End of Tacoma with his wife, Dixie, dog, Charlie and has several children and grandchildren in the Tacoma area.","","","2017","","","","","xyz","","","University of Washington Tacoma Community History Project","","chp2017-05","","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-EDU/1.0/?language=en","","cpd","","","660","tchp660","","https://digitalcollections.lib.washington.edu//utils/getthumbnail/collection/tacomacomm/id/660","","erika-b.github.io/tchp_dev/items/tchp660.html"

"Engaging Tacoma Buddhism: Acculturation at the Tacoma Buddhism Temple","In April of 2019, a Pacific Lutheran University Religion 393 class set out to interview members of the Tacoma Buddhist Temple with the purpose to study the acculturation of religion and the ways that the role of religion in the Tacoma community has changed overtime. The class was broken down into three groups of 3-4 students each in order to interview Miyoko Kanda, Donna Sasaki and Crystal Inge, who are all members of the Tacoma Buddhist Temple. Each person was interviewed in order to glean more information about the time period they were most active in and specific questions regarding temple culture. This project was initiated with the intent to preserve the different perspectives of the members mentioned above through oral history as an ongoing project to collect and archive oral histories of relevant members of Tacoma from its foundation to present day.","","","2019","","","","","xyz","","","University of Washington Tacoma Community History Project","","chp 2019-01","","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-EDU/1.0/?language=en","","cpd","","","671","tchp671","","https://digitalcollections.lib.washington.edu//utils/getthumbnail/collection/tacomacomm/id/671","","erika-b.github.io/tchp_dev/items/tchp671.html"

"Pandemic in Her Baby Sling: The Iranian American Women&#39;s Story of Migration Traumas and Labor Hardship During 2020&#39;s COVID-19 Pandemic","Since COVID-19 started to become a global pandemic, it has caused personal and public traumas. Increase in unemployment rate, bankruptcy of small businesses, financial stress to the middle and working-class and the closure of many businesses which relied on people’s social activities, including the gig industry, tourism industry and restaurants, are additional traumas to the issues of health and life threats people face by the contingency of the virus. By the end of May 2020, more than 2 million Americans were confirmed COVID-19 positive, 113 thousand of whom could not survive. Amongst the most affected populations, the people of color, especially Black Americans and immigrants have been suffering most. This research focuses on immigrant working women from the Middle East, whose life journeys are filled in with several traumas, some intensified during the pandemic. This paper provides two oral history records of two Iranian American working mothers, Aida Mohajer and Mrs. Ebrahimi, who carry historical traumas experienced in two different countries with two different cultures, i.e. Iran, and the USA. The interviewees’ stories show how the experience of trauma is related to the social class and what imposed social factors beyond choice can determine the class and different approaches to traumas.","","","2020","","","","","COVID-19 (Disease); Iranian American women; single mothers; immigrants; precarious employment; oral history","","","University of Washington Tacoma Community History Project","","chp2020-03","","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-EDU/1.0/?language=en","","cpd","","","695","tchp695","","https://digitalcollections.lib.washington.edu//utils/getthumbnail/collection/tacomacomm/id/695","","erika-b.github.io/tchp_dev/items/tchp695.html"
