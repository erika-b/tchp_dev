In two interview segments, Rabbi Rosenthal discusses early Jewish settlement in Tacoma, the 1960 merger of existing Conservative and Reform congregations to form Temple Beth El, and adds some details about his early life and training. Farber recounts his beliefs about misguided urban renewal practices of the 1960s and 1970s and reminisces about the many businesses that once flourished in downtown Tacoma. The transcript of the interview with Hurst appears to provide only an excerpt; she discusses her family business, Feist & Bachrach, as well as other downtown Tacoma stores operating prior to 1965.","Farber, Steph--Interviews; Hurst, Lucille--Interviews; Rosenthal, Richard, 1924-1999--Interviews; LeRoy Jewelers (Tacoma, Wash.); Temple Beth El (Tacoma, Wash.); Central business districts--Washington (State)--Tacoma; Jewelers--Washington (State)--Tacoma--Interviews; Jews--Washington (State)--Tacoma--Interviews; Jews--Washington (State)--Tacoma--History; Rabbis--Washington (State)--Tacoma--Interviews; Single mothers--Washington (State)--Tacoma--Interviews; Stores, Retail--Washington (State)--Tacoma--History; Women sculptors--Washington (State)--Tacoma--Interviews; Tacoma (Wash.)--Commerce--History",United States--Washington (State)--Tacoma,,,University of Washington Tacoma Community History Project,chp1992-05,text,cpd,,,http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-EDU/1.0/?language=en,,,

tchp572,572,The Burley Community: Preserving the Past,"Moore, Maria; Laxson, Barbara","Wilson, Tom",2015,"The Burley Utopian Community was part of the growing Social Equity Movement of the latter part of the 19th and early part of the 20th centuries. The origin of the idea of seeding the United States with Socialist Communities came from an organization led by Eugene V Debs. Debs was a veteran of the labor troubles that gripped the nation beginning in the 1880's and culminated with the deaths of thirteen workers during the Pullman Strike. Debs began to believe that the only hope for the workingman was Socialism. With that in mind the national Socialist organization looked for opportunities to spread the Socialism, Washington State was selected as the site of the colony, chosen because of its history of labor activism and a smaller population that would be sympathetic to the cause. Thus was born the town/colony of Brotherhood, a name that was soon surrendered for the commonly used, Burley. Plagued with troubles from the onset, the colony lasted only 15 years. This is story of a community that has survived, not so much physically, but in spirit, a spirit that still holds this small community together today. That spirit can be seen in the words of Barbara Laxson who is a longtime resident who lives in one of the original homes built by the colony where an oral history was recorded. It can also be heard in the words of Maria Moore, an American citizen born in Mexico who lives now in Burley. Mrs. Moore, is a former member of the Burley Community Association the group that is charged with maintaining the community properties, her interview was conducted in the community park. In their words you can begin to understand why it is so important to try to keep and keep the history and the name Burley alive today.",,United States - Washington (State) - Tacoma; United States - Washington (State) - Kitsap County,,,University of Washington Tacoma Community History Project,chp2015-01,,cpd,,,http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-EDU/1.0/?language=en,,,

He is certainly one of the longest lasting. Shortly after arriving in Tacoma in 1957 Mr. McCollum purchased the K Street Department Store which was located on the corner of 12th and K. He operated the store for several years. At the time the K Street business sector, one of the city's twelve business districts, was second only to downtown Tacoma in terms of business activity. Businesses such as hardware stores, banks, small department stores, appliance dealers, butchers, markets, cleaners, clothing stores, and restaurants lined the streets. In 1960, he moved to 11th and Broadway and opened what to become the quintessential men's store ""Mac the Knife,"" later shortened to ""Mr. Mac's."" At the time the Tacoma business district was being adversely affected by the building of the Tacoma Mall which would, after its completion, lure many of the surrounding businesses to it. Mr. Mac stayed, however, and became president of the K Street Booster Club, an organization dedicated to promoting the interests of small family owned businesses and the community that surrounded them. In addition to having an active interest in the business community Mr. McCollum also became dedicated to the areas youths and his interests in sports, boxing in particular, lead him to becoming involved with the Tacoma Athletic Commission, eventually becoming its president in 1978.

Disease would continue to wage war against the residents of the City of Destiny until the Fannie C. Paddock Memorial Hospital and St. Joseph Hospital were built in 1882 and 1891, respectively. Both organizations developed meaningful relationships with their community and ignited a behind-the-scenes competition which would benefit both patient and physician. Almost 100 years later, Tacoma was cared for predominantly by primary care physicians. It had just started to see an influx of medical specialists via Madigan Army Medical Center when the city was hit by HIV in 1983. With no effective cure at the time, Tacoma did its best to cope with the disease and its associated complications, and the infectious disease specialists were on the forefront. One of these few physicians was Dr. Peter Marsh. Born in  Chicago in 1949, he was inspired to become a doctor as a young boy by the Dr. Kildare film series. Arriving in Tacoma in 1981, he would find himself in the middle of handling the AIDS epidemic, supporting patients as best as he could before they succumbed to the disease; that is, until the introduction of antiretroviral medications. Now able to effectively cure patients, Dr. Marsh found new life in his work and continued to serve his community until retirement in 2015. With the epidemic under control, Tacoma still utilizes what it learned from that chaotic era to stand prepared for anything thrown its way.",,United States - Washington (State) - Tacoma,,,University of Washington Tacoma Community History Project,chp2015-06,,cpd,,,http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-EDU/1.0/?language=en,,,

Mr. Olson is a lifelong South Tacoma resident and has vivid memories of the time both before and after I-5 and the Mall. As of yet the Tacoma Community History Project has no oral history pertaining to South Tacoma; thus it is an aim of this project to resolve that omission. The methodology used was a personal interview with Mr. Olson using pre-conceived, open-ended questions based on prior research. The interview was conducted in such a manner so as to be as respectful to Mr. Olson while at the same time keeping the focus of the interview on the changes and history of South Tacoma. The results of the interview show that indeed prior to I-5 and the Mall the South Tacoma Business District was a thriving, wholesome area that catered to the everyday needs of the surrounding residents. However, the completions of I-5 and the Mall undoubtedly altered the atmosphere of the area; Mr. Olson can attest to these changes.

tchp629,629,When Races Collide: Willie Stewart and the Voluntary Desegregation of Tacoma Public Schools,"Stewart, Willie","Jennison, Katherine L.",2017,"On the heels of the Brown v. Board of Education decision and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Tacoma School District took voluntary measures to desegregate a select number of schools with high non-white enrollment. The district superintendent, Dr. Angelo Giaudrone, drew attention to the de facto segregation, and primarily focused on two elementary schools: Stanley Elementary, with a black population of 64 percent and McCarver Elementary, with a black population of 84 percent. In 1963, a subcommittee was formed to analyze and study the de facto segregation and provide recommendations for potential solutions. On July 8, 1966, a plan was announced by the school board for an optional enrollment program that relied on closing McCarver Junior High and to provide limited open enrollment to students affected by the closing. The district hired its first black principal, Willie Stewart, in 1970 in order to bridge the divide between the school district and the black community. Stewart led the summer counseling program to work with families on the transition between the closing of their neighborhood school and their new school of their choice. According to the United States Commission on Civil Rights a decade later, the summer counseling program was pivotal to the success of the voluntary desegregation program in the Tacoma School District.",xyz,United States -- Washington (State) -- Tacoma,,,University of Washington Tacoma Community History Project,chp2017-02,,cpd,,,http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-EDU/1.0/?language=en,,,

The same year Laurie started first grade, McCarver Elementary in Tacoma became the first magnet school in the country and began the desegregation process of Tacoma Public Schools. Though Laurie only attended through fifth grade, her experiences there lasted a lifetime. Throughout her educational journey, Laurie attended many schools, and the one that remained clearest in her memory was McCarver. One of her fondest memories was Friday Activities, and she could still recall the teachers she had as well which teams she belonged to. Laurie lived in Hilltop most of her childhood and only spent about seven or eight years away before returning home to Tacoma for good. In that time, she lived and attended schools in Seattle until age fourteen. Roughly a month into her ninth grade year, Laurie dropped out of school and moved to Florida until age seventeen. Upon her return, Laurie completed her GED, Associate�s, Bachelor�s, and Master�s degrees all in the South Puget Sound region. She taught at the Tacoma Urban League for many years before she found her way to Bates Technical College where she currently works. Laurie continues to serve the Tacoma community and is a proud Hilltop native.",xyz,United States -- Washington (State) -- Tacoma,,,University of Washington Tacoma Community History Project,chp2017-03,,cpd,,,http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-EDU/1.0/?language=en,,,

Nancy's parents are Donald and Janet McCloud. She has seven siblings and grew up on the banks of the Nisqually River and Puyallup Rivers and currently resides in Yelm, Washington. Nancy grew up during the fishing wars that took place on both the Nisqually and Puyallup Rivers. Her mother Janet McCloud and her uncle, Billy Frank Jr., were very active advocates during the battle over salmon. She remembers vividly the violence, racism and injustices that she and her people suffered as they fought for what was rightfully theirs. By revisiting the circumstances and propositions set forth in the Medicine Creek Treaty of 1854, a better understanding of what the Puyallup and Nisqually tribes have been fighting for comes into focus. While the Boldt Decision of 1974 was a turning point for Northwest Tribes, concerns such as climate change, overpopulation, and proposals such as the LNG plant in Tacoma continue to put the salmon runs at risk.",xyz,United States -- Washington (State); United States -- Washington (State) -- Tacoma; United States -- Washington (State) -- Yelm,,,University of Washington Tacoma Community History Project,chp2017-06,,cpd,,,http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-EDU/1.0/?language=en,,,

Philip's father, Philip Red Eagle, a member of the Dakota Tribe, was born near the Missouri River on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in Montana. Phillip spent the first fourteen years of his life in Tacoma, attending Stanley and McCarver schools before moving to Sitka, Alaska with his family in 1959. Philip joined the Navy shortly after graduating from high school, serving in Vietnam for five years from 1969-1973. After Vietnam, Philip returned to Washington and began undergraduate studies at the University of Washington where he earned two bachelor's degrees. The return to civilian life after the war affected Philip and he struggled with PTSD and related issues like depression and insomnia. Philip found that art, writing, and taking part in the revival of his culture helped him confront his PTSD and over the last 30 years Philip has contributed greatly to the revival and expansion of Indigenous culture in the Pacific Northwest.",xyz,United States -- Washington (State) -- Tacoma; United States -- Montana (State); United States -- Alaska (State) -- Sitka; United States -- Washington -- Seattle,,,University of Washington Tacoma Community History Project,chp2017-07,,cpd,,,http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-EDU/1.0/?language=en,,,

Arneklev earned his bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of Oregon and his Educational Doctorate in educational psychology at Utah State University before moving out with his family of five for an evaluation role with the Tacoma School District. Arneklev was hired to evaluate the district's Emergency School Aid Act for its first four years, 1973-1977. ESAA was a federal program that funded school desegregation efforts. Tacoma began voluntarily desegregating its schools in 1966 with a limited school choice enrollment for its segregated central-area schools and expanding to district-wide enrollment policies to reduce effects of de facto segregation over the next three years. Arneklev worked for an additional twelve years in the district's evaluation department before working as a school psychologist for ten years, retiring in 2000.

Increase in unemployment rate, bankruptcy of small businesses, financial stress to the middle and working-class and the closure of many businesses which relied on people’s social activities, including the gig industry, tourism industry and restaurants, are additional traumas to the issues of health and life threats people face by the contingency of the virus. By the end of May 2020, more than 2 million Americans were confirmed COVID-19 positive, 113 thousand of whom could not survive. Amongst the most affected populations, the people of color, especially Black Americans and immigrants have been suffering most. This research focuses on immigrant working women from the Middle East, whose life journeys are filled in with several traumas, some intensified during the pandemic. This paper provides two oral history records of two Iranian American working mothers, Aida Mohajer and Mrs. Ebrahimi, who carry historical traumas experienced in two different countries with two different cultures, i.e. Iran, and the USA. The interviewees’ stories show how the experience of trauma is related to the social class and what imposed social factors beyond choice can determine the class and different approaches to traumas.",COVID-19 (Disease); Iranian American women; single mothers; immigrants; precarious employment; oral history,United States—Washington (State)—Tacoma; United States—Washington (State)—Seattle; United States—Washington (State)—Kirkland,,,University of Washington Tacoma Community History Project,chp2020-03,,cpd,,,http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-EDU/1.0/?language=en,,,
